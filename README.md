# Mapping-Mobility-Service
### Final Project Javascript Prompt
Build a single page web with the following characteristics:
- Can use any mix of HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Submit an "index.html" file having:
  - A short description
  - A link to the project
  - Any relevant technical details or comments
  - Anything that could be improved for a 2.0 version

The idea is to find a public API that has geographical information on transport services: bus stops, refuel stations, train lines, etc. Information must be loaded, parsed and then displayed on a map. You should allow filtering of the different services (i.e. by metro/bus lines, by type, by price range, etc.)

### Work structure
1. Research and Select an API: First, research and select a suitable API that provides geographical information on transport services, such as bus stops, refuel stations, train lines, etc. Some examples include the Google Maps API, OpenStreetMap, and HERE Technologies. You will need to sign up for an API key and familiarize yourself with the API documentation to understand how to make requests and retrieve data.
2. Plan and Design the Project: Once you have selected an API, it's time to plan and design your project. Start by creating a wireframe or mockup of your single-page web application, which includes the features and functionalities you want to include. Consider the design and layout of the page, the color scheme, and the typography. Think about how the data from the API will be displayed on the map, and how users will be able to filter the data.
3. Develop the Webpage: With your plan and design in place, it's time to start developing your webpage. You can use any mix of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build your webpage. Start by creating the basic HTML structure and then add CSS to style the webpage. Next, add JavaScript code to load, parse and display the data from the API on the map. Make sure to include comments in your code to explain what each section does.
4. Test and Debug: Once you have built the webpage, it's time to test it thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected. Test the webpage on different devices and browsers to ensure that it's responsive and user-friendly. Debug any errors or issues that you encounter during testing.
5. Submit the Project: Finally, when you are satisfied with your project, create an index.html file with a short description, a link to the project, any relevant technical details or comments, and anything that could be improved for a 2.0 version. Submit your project to your instructor or share it with your peers for feedback.
