# Mapping-Mobility-Service
### Final Project Javascript Prompt
Build a single page web with the following characteristics:
- Can use any mix of HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Submit an "index.html" file having:
  - A short description
  - A link to the project
  - Any relevant technical details or comments
  - Anything that could be improved for a 2.0 version

The idea is to find a public API that has geographical information on transport services: bus stops, refuel stations, train lines, etc. Information must be loaded, parsed and then displayed on a map. You should allow filtering of the different services (i.e. by metro/bus lines, by type, by price range, etc.)

### Work structure
1. **Select an API**: Firstly, I researched which Maps API I was going to use for this project. I opted to go for Google Maps API. 
2. **Plan and Design the Project**: Once I have selected an API, it was time to plan and design your project. I started by creating a first sketch of the web pages I needed for the project. Given the task I opted to go for 2 different HTML web pages, both connected to the Google Maps API:
    - WelcomePage.html: A web page to explain what this web app do as well as some suggestion on where to go with the map
    - Directions.html: A web page that gets 2 inputs from the user and returns a way to get from one to the other
3. **Develop the Webpage**: With your plan and design in place, it was time to start developing my webpages. I used a mix of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build my webpage. Start by creating the basic HTML structure and then add CSS to style the webpage. Next, add JavaScript code to load, parse and display the data from the API on the map.
4. **Test and Debug**: Once I had built the webpage, it was time to test it thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected.
5. **Possible improvements**: Some possible improvements I could implement to the project are:
